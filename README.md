## Flask Backend API Server
1. Create a python [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#create-it) and run it.

2. Install dependencies
```
    pip install requirements.txt
```

3. Change directory into [backend](./backend/) and run the server.
```
    python ./app.py
```
