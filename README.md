# Getting Started
This part walks you through how to run the application locally. It involves two parts, (i) the Flask backend server and (ii) the React frontend application.

## Flask Backend API Server
1. Create a python [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#create-it) and run it.

2. Install dependencies
```
    pip install requirements.txt
```

3. [Install Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) and start redis server (for server side session handling).

4. Change directory into [backend](./backend/) and run the server.
```
    python ./app.py
```

## React Frontend Web Application
